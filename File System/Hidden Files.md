# Hidden Files

Files and folders can be hidden by putting a period in front of the file/folder name (e. g. `.hiddenFile`). That means that you must treat these files/folders as hidden.
Hidden files/folders are meant to be used by applications or operating systems to hide configuration files etc. Don't misuse these for other purposes.

Apart from that, the following files and folders are hidden:

- Desktop.ini
- Thumbs.db
