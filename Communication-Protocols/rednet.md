protocol ID | rednet

Rednet is a standard protocol included in computercraft. It is intented to be used as transmission method for other protocols.

## Rednet Message ##

A Rednet Message consists of the following informations:

type | name | description
---- | ---- | -----------
number | nRecipient | the target: either a computer ID or 65535 for broadcast
number | nAnswerChannel | the ID of the computer which created the message
table | tMessage | table mentioned below

tMessage table:

type | name | describtion
---- | -----| -----------
number | nMessageID | a random number from 1 to 2147483647
number | nRecipient | the target computer ID or 65535 for broadcast
any data | message | the data to be transmitted, specified by the protocol
string | sProtocol | protocol ID of the used protocol

sProtocol can also be nil but it is **highly recommended to always send a valid Protocol ID in sProtocol**

## Transmission ##

### If nRecipient equals nAnswerChannel ###

The message doesn´t leave the computer and gets handled as an ingoing message.

### If sender computer ID doesn´t equal reciever computer ID ###

#### Sending ####

Two modem packages get sent:

field | value
----- | -----
channel | nRecipient
replyChannel | nReplyChannel
message | tMessage

field | value
----- | -----
channel | 65533
replyChannel | nReplyChannel
message | tMessage

#### Repeating ####

A repeater listens to channel 65533 and waits for incoming rednet messages. Everytime it recieves one it looks if it already had transmitted a packet with the same nMessageID, if it hasn´t it sends two packets using the same pattern as for a sending task.

**Attention:** *nReplyChannel has to be the same as in the incoming message!*

#### Recieving ####

A recieving computer listens to the channel whichs number is equal to its Computer ID and on channel 65535. When it recieves one, it checks if it recieved a message with the same nMessageID, if it hasn´t it handles the packet as an ingoing message
