## Technical details
The format is similar to the paintutils image format in that colours are defined using a hexadecimal character (`0-9`
and `a-f`). Refer to the paintutils document for specifics.

Unlike the paintutils format, however, this format allows characters and text colours to be saved, in addition to the
background colour.

### Special characters
The format uses two special characters, a character whose byte is `30` and another whose byte is `31`.


| Byte | Represents                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
|  30  | Background colour definition |
|  31  | Text colour definition       |

If a `30` or `31` character is encountered the character immediately after will be a hexadecimal. If the character is
`30` the colour represented by the hexadecimal becomes the 'active' background colour. Hence, any proceeding pixels will
use the active background colour (until the next `30` character changes it). The same applies with the `31` character,
but it instead sets the text colour.
If the colour specified after one of these characters is a space character instead of an hexadecimal then the colour will
be set to transparent.

### Text characters
Any character that is not `30`, `31` or the character immediately after those two represents the character that should
be written to the screen. A space represents a blank (background colour only) pixel.

As with the paintutils format, each line represents a row of pixels. When the line ends 'active' background and text
colours are reset, with the default being transparent.

### Example
In this example the `30` character is represented by `@`, the `31` character by `#` and a space character by `∙`

```
@4∙@3#bnft
@3∙∙@d∙∙
@d∙∙∙∙
```
