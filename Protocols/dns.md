## Technical Details

DNS defines a method of looking up hostnames in the context of protocols.

Any computer can broadcast a `lookup` for a hostname/protocol pair and will receive a `lookup response` from computers who identify themselves with the corresponding hostname/protocol pair.

Because it's not just hostnames but hostname/protocol pairs, there can be several computers using the same hostname for serving different protocols.

A computer can identify himself with every hostname/protocol pair he wants and with as many hostname/protocol pairs as he wants, as long as there are no duplicated hostname/protocol pairs in the world. The computer HAS TO lookup a hostname/protocol pair before identifying with it, if it is taken, the computer is NOT ALLOWED to identify with it.

Packets are composed of 3 strings:
* the package type
* the hostname
* the protocol

These strings are combined in a table:

```
  {
  sType = "<package type>"
  sHostname = "<hostname>"
  sProtocol = "<protocol>"
  }
```

### Looking up a hostname/protocol pair

* The uplooking computer broadcasts a package of type `lookup`, where the hostname and protocol string are the hostname/protocol pair to look up.
* If a computer identifies himself with that hostname/protocol pair, it responds directly to the uplooking computer with a package of type `lookup response`, where the hostname and protocol strings are the hostname/protocol pair, the responding computer identifies himself with.
